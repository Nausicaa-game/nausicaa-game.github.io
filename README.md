# Nausicaa: Mythological Strategy Board Game üèπüîÆ

## Game Concept

Nausicaa is a turn-based, deck-building strategy game that brings mythological beings to life on a dynamic 10x8 battlefield. Inspired by chess and mythological warfare, players build decks, manage mana, and strategically deploy legendary creatures to defeat their opponent.

## Core Game Components

Eliminate the opponent's **Oracle** (King equivalent) to win the game.
